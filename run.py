"""
This module implements automated scan and upload tool using API.

This module provides functions to manage and interact with network
devices and IP addresses using the NetBox API. It includes functionality
to retrieve device information, add new devices, update device
configurations, manage manufacturers, and export host data to
a CSV file.

Module Usage:
    This module requires the configuration file `config.yml` to contain
     API tokens and base URL for the NetBox API. It also depends on the
     `requests` and `xml.etree.ElementTree` libraries for interacting
     with the API and parsing Nmap XML output.
